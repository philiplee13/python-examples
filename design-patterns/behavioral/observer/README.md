## Use Cases

- Pattern that lets us define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events to the object they're observing
- A real world example of this is a newsletter
  - those who want to get updates -> subscribe
  - those who don't -> unsubscribe

## When to Use

- When a change to one object means that changes to other objects may need to happen
- When objects need to observe / subscribe to another for a given set of time
